# Code refactor for HoriSEOn

# On the job ticket

This project involves working with the customer HoriSEOn to take their existing code and improve it using HTML semantic elements.
I built this project because as a developer working on another person’s code it is best practice to improve the code without altering the code’s external behaviour. Refactoring the code can improve the structure which makes it easier to understand and reduces complexities. For instance, with the use of semantic HTML in this project, search engines and other devices can determine the relevance and context of web pages. Pages with semantic HTML tags are easier to read, more accessibly and more user-friendly. Furthermore, changes made to the code can help developers find bugs that are hidden in the software.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
